tib is an interpreter for a subset of TI-BASIC with a few convenience features added written in cross-platform C++.

**tib does not aim to be a calculator.** It can certainly be used as one if you want, but it is focused on being an interpreter for a programming language. For this reason some feautures are not supported, such as the graph view, yvars, plotting functions and others. If you desire those features there are plenty of TI calculator emulator projects available.

## Goals
The tib project's goals are
1. **Any valid TI-BASIC program is a valid tib program**
   
   This includes any syntatic oddities that TI calculators have, except for obvious bugs `Disp "HELLO:Disp (1(2(3` is a valid program.

   Those who prefer a stricter no-nonsense subset of TI-BASIC can pass the `-s` or `--strict` paramater to disallow such shenanigans
2. **An invalid TI-BASIC program is not necessarily an invalid tib program**

   This means that things that might crash your calculator will run fine under tib. For example, `{"HELLO","TI-84"}` will throw an `ERR:DATA TYPE` error on a calculator, but tib will happily except it.

   Those who so desire can pass the `-e` or `--emulate` paramater for a more authentic calculator experience.
3. **Implement the parts of TI-BASIC that are useful as a general-purpose programming language**

    While an effort will be made to implement as many functions TI-BASIC provides, some things that just aren't useful won't be implemented. For instance, complex number support probably won't happen, as it isn't generally very useful in programming. yvars likely fall into the same category

## FAQ

### How do I install tib?
Tib is a simple project, it is all self contained in one executable with no other dependencies (`tib.exe` on Windows, `tib` on UNIX-y systems). For Windows users, simply extract it to a folder and add it to your `%PATH%`. UNIX-y systems will likely have to do [something like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025).

### Where can I see what is supported?
See syntax.md

### Why doesn't tib support `ClrHome`, `Pause`, or `Output(`?
In order to support these commands, tib will need to bring in some third party terminal library, like Curses, to manipulate the terminal window more. Work needs to be done to identify one that is simple and cross platform. 

For now, `ClrHome` and `Pause` are implemented in a hacky way, by calling `system("cls")` and `system("pause")`

### Does tib support the graph screen?

No, and it probably won't for the forseable future. Implementing the graph screen would require some cross platform GUI library, which would be a significant dependency and codebase change. For now, the focus is on completing the text-mode portion of TI-BASIC.

Even if in the distant future tib gets graph screen support, it will not support most calculator related features, such as graphing functions, finding integrals and intercepts, etc.
